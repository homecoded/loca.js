loca.js
=======

This is a complete client-side localization module for web apps written in JavaScript.

It uses data-attributes to flag elements that should be translated. For texts use spans. Buttons are also supported.
Variables in the translations are supported.

Code-Example
------------

HTML:

    <!-- The span content will be automatically replaced with the entry "txt_loca_1" from the dictionary -->
    <span data-loca-id="txt_loca_1"></span>

    <!-- The button value will be automatically translated, requires an id -->
    <input type="button" id="button_example" value="txt_button">

JavaScript:

    // create a dictionary
    var loca__dictionary = {
        "txt_loca_1":
            [
                    "loca.js - a client-side localization framework in JavaScript",
                    "loca.js - eine client-seitiges Lokalisierungs-Framework in JavaScript"
            ],
        "txt_button":
            [
                    "My button",
                    "Mein Knopf"
            ]
    };

    // define the languages
    var LNG_ENGLISH = 0, LNG_GERMAN = 1;

    // initalize dictionary
    loca.setDict(loca__dictionary);

    // translate everything on the page to english (language with id 0)
    loca.applyLocalization(LNG_ENGLISH);
